# Benchmarking_TCR_Reconstruction
Benchmark of T cell receptor construction methods from scRNA-seq data![image](https://github.com/RuonanTian/Benchmarking_TCR_Reconstruction/assets/36098999/5186cfa8-3a9b-4e9a-b241-3d8a84e0c2d2)
## Introduction
We benchmark existing methods about TCR-seq reconstruction. The statistic results and visualization code in this project can be avaliable.

1. Simulation_results: The simulation results in this project refer to the generated synthetic data using the YASIM-scTCR simulator.These synthetic datasets were used for subsequent analysis, statistical evaluations, and visualization to assess the performance of different TCR reconstruction methods.
2. Split_data_code: The split data code is a custom Python script developed to split the 10x scRNA-seq data based on cell barcodes, resulting in individual cell-level data.
3. Statistic_code: The statistic code is a set of Python scripts or functions used to calculate the accuracy and sensitivity of each TCR reconstruction method.
4. Statistic_results: The statistic results refer to the computed accuracy and sensitivity values for each TCR reconstruction method.
5. Visualization_code: The visualization code comprises custom scripts or functions developed to create visual representations of the statistical results.
